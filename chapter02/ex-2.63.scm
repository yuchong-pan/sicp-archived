;; a. The 2 procedures produce the same result for every tree; both of them produce the inorder traverse of the given tree. The 2
;;    procedures both produce '(1 3 5 7 9 11) for each of the trees in Figure 2.16.
;;
;; b. The 2 procedures have the same order of growth in the number of steps required to convert a balanced tree with n elements to a list;
;;    both of them require Theta(n) steps.
