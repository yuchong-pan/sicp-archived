;; Suppose R1 is a resistor with the center of 100 ohms and the percentage tolerance of 1%, and R2 is a resistor with the center of 200
;; ohms and the percentage tolerance of 1%.
;; The parallel-resistor given by par1 is a resister with the center of 83.23 ohms and the percentage tolerance of 21.36%, and that given
;; by par2 is a resistor with the center of 66.67 ohms and the percentage tolerance of 0.84%.
;; Hence, Lem is right.
;;
;; Suppose A is an interval with the center of 100 and the percentage tolerance of 1%, and B is an interval with the center of 200 and the
;; percentage tolerance of 1%.
;; We have A/A is an interval with the center of 1.0002 and the percentage tolerance of 2.00%, and A/B is an interval with the center of
;; 0.50004 and the percentage tolerance of 2.01%.
;; Hence, I conclude that, after arithmetic operations, the percentage tolerance will be considerably incremented.
